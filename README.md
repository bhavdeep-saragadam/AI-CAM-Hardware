<h2>There Is Nothing There Because The Project Will Be Starting In The Next Month</h2>

This is just like the software version but I I feel like I am going to make this more wide and let it have more features...


And To make this I planed to use the raspberry pi 4. Learn More About It In https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/what-%20is-a-raspberry-pi/...


I also am going to be making a street roaming robot to make it learn about the diffrent patterns of the human activity...
So The Robot is going to store the video clips and the images to the cloud.. 


ALL OF THIS IDEA MIGHT BE LITTLE TOO MUCH.. But it would like a trail and error expreince and I would not regret anything even if the robot messes up or does not go by plan. 

I Also Set Up Disccosions so if you have anyother Ideas I would be happy to consider them...



BTW The name will probably change knowing that it is already taken.
